# Anthem for Doomed Youth
<p>What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?</p>
<p>--Only the monstrous anger of the guns.</p>
<p>Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle</p>
<p>Can patter out their hasty orisons.</p>
<p>No mockeries for them from prayers or bells,</p>
<p>Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,-</p>
<p>The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;</p>
<p>And bugles calling for them from sad shires.</p>
<p>-- Wilfred Owen's 'Anthem for Doomed Youth'</p>
