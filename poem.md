# Anthem for Doomed Youth

What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?

--Only the _monstrous_ anger of the guns.

Only the <b>stuttering rifles'</b> rapid rattle

Can patter out their hasty orisons.

No mockeries for them from prayers or bells,

Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,-

The shrill, demented choirs of *wailing shells*;

And bugles calling for them from sad shires.

By <i>Wilfred Owen</i>
